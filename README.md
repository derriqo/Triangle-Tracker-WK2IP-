### Author Information
My name is **Derrick William** the creator of this application.I am a student a **Moringa School** training to be a software developer.


## Setup Instruction
To get started with this application you need to simply not get Internet Connection and get Started.

## BDD
**Feature:** As a user , I want to know given types of triangles using the length measurements inputed.

 **Background:**

There exists the following types of triangles
1. Obtuse.
2. Equilateral.
3. Scalene.
4. Right Angled.
5. Obtuse.
6. Acute.


 Given that this Application only tests for __three__ of the given Triangles since they are determined by their length size.

 **Implementation**
As a developer i introduced the user to the application and how to start off. Once the user inputs data specifically in form of numbers . I collect the values inputed and validate them for the computer. This now enables the process of checking the various conditions of forming the triangles and hence manage to identify a given triangle.

## Technologies Used
The application runs on:
1. HTML 5
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
